# M21-Challenge

This project creates a search engine with great help from the Google Books API using the MERN stack.

## Project Description

This app is a book search engine in which you can create a profile to save books you want to read, along with pictures and descriptions. The information comes from the Google Books API. Even without creating a profile, you can still search different books by title and many will appear with the same word you searched in the title.

## Technologies Used

The MERN stack:
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* React
* Node.js

* The Google Books API
* GraphQL
* Apollo Server
* Heroku (Not yet tho)

## Install and Run

It's pretty simple, you just clone this into your computer and open it on your VS Code app. Then, once you opened the file, you open the integrated terminal and type in the following command:
* npm i

This may take some time, but once it's all complete, type in:
* npm start

This may also take some time, but your browser will open automatically on your localhost:3001 and you can go ahead and start searching for your next book to read!
